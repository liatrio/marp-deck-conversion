# This is the deckset on Deckset

"Deckset designs your slides, so you can focus on your ideas"

Write down your thoughts in your favorite text editor, and Deckset will turn them into beautiful presentations.

---

## Understanding the UI

- the **Edit** tab brings up the MD in a textedit where you can edit the slides without a separate editor

- the **Themes** tab gives you different options for preset themes for slides

- the **Customize** tab allows you to customize different aspects of slides

- use **View** to shift between seeing all slides and focusing on specific slides

---

## Understanding the markdown

- "---" three dashes is how you separate slides within the MD file

- "global commands" belong at the top of the MD file and apply to all slides automatically. By default, they are set to false. They can also be applied/overridden per slide

- A list of possible commands/configurations can be found here: [config](https://www.deckset.com/help/tutorials/using-configuration-commands.html)

### First slide deck basics

- Adding images to slides is easy.
	* Can reference local/online image like normal in MD
	* Easiest way is to drag and drop image into Deckset to auto-generate image MD syntax
- For slides that are image focused, you can add **^ Speaker Notes** that only appear in the presenter display. (Can see this using rehearsal mode)
